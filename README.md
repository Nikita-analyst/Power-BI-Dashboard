Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project repository! This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to understand the patterns and factors influencing higher cancellation rates in resort hotels compared to city hotels. The analysis is performed using various data analysis techniques and visualizations.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to investigate the reasons behind the higher cancellation rates observed in resort hotels compared to city hotels. By analyzing the booking data, we aim to uncover trends and insights that can help hotel management devise strategies to reduce cancellations and improve booking retention.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the hotel bookings which contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. The dataset includes details such as booking dates, lead times, customer demographics, booking status, and more.

Key Findings
Cancellation Rate Comparison: The analysis reveals that the cancellation rate for resort hotels is significantly higher than that for city hotels.
Seasonal Trends: Seasonal variations play a crucial role in cancellation rates, with higher cancellations observed during peak vacation seasons for resort hotels.
Lead Time Impact: Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates in resort hotels, suggesting that bookings made well in advance are more likely to be canceled.
Customer Demographics: Differences in customer demographics between resort and city hotel bookings influence cancellation behavior.
Booking Channels: The mode of booking (online, travel agency, direct) impacts the likelihood of cancellations, with resort hotels seeing higher cancellations from certain channels.
